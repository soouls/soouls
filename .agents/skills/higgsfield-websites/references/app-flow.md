# App flow — `type: "app"` (Higgsfield-integrated, Quanta + HeroUI)

You are building ONE per-website Cloudflare Worker: a **React 19 + TanStack
Start** app that is **server-rendered (SSR)** and deploys as a single Worker
served at the app's own subdomain. A `type: "app"` product is tightly
integrated with Higgsfield: its users **Sign in with Higgsfield** and generate
images/videos through the **fnf SDK**, and the app must look and feel like a
Higgsfield product — apps render INSIDE Higgsfield, indistinguishable from its
own tools. There is no independent brand and no wow/marketing pipeline here:
the craft bar is Quanta's UX-craft rules plus the brand-review self-check.

**Repo layout.** The project lives in **`app/`** — its own `package.json`,
`src/`, `packages/`, `migrations/`, build config, and the deploy inputs
(`app.manifest.json`, `wrangler.jsonc`). Run every `bun`/build command from
there.

## What you have to build with

- **Quanta** (`@higgsfield/quanta`) — Higgsfield's design system, vendored in
  the template. MANDATORY: use its components before writing custom chrome.
  `references/quanta-design.md` is the working guide (tokens, components,
  UX-craft rules, the Higgsfield integration rules); the canonical API
  reference is `app/packages/quanta/ai/AGENTS.md`.
- **The five layout scaffolds** (`references/app-layouts.md` +
  `app/src/layouts/AGENTS.md`) — cinema studio / stepper / simple app (form) /
  upscaler / shorts studio, each modeled on a live Higgsfield product. Start
  from the closest; a custom layout is fine when the user asks. The composer,
  feed, and result cards are BUILT per app from Quanta primitives — the same
  reference carries their anatomy.
- **HeroUI fallback** (`references/heroui-fallback.md`) — `@heroui/react` is
  preinstalled and themed to the brand for components Quanta lacks (date
  picker, calendar, data table, …). Never where Quanta has the component;
  never restyled.
- **Icons** — Google Material Symbols outlined 400, imported per icon
  (`@material-symbols/svg-400/outlined/<name>.svg?react`). The generate-button
  sparkle is the branded `@/assets/icon-sparkles-soft.svg?react`.
- **fnf SDK** (`references/fnf-sdk.md`) + **React bindings**
  (`references/fnf-react.md`) — generation jobs, media, profile, workspace,
  credits. `@higgsfield/fnf` ships the SDK core plus ONE bundled adapter:
  `createWorkflowPlatformAdapter` at `@higgsfield/fnf/workflow-platform` (the
  old `@higgsfield/fnf/adapters` subpath no longer exists; other adapters live
  in `@higgsfield/fnf-adapters`, which generated apps do not use). Package
  guides are canonical for APIs: `app/packages/fnf/ai/AGENTS.md` and
  `app/packages/fnf-react/ai/AGENTS.md`.
- **Higgsfield auth** (`references/auth.md`) — the `/api/user` proxy,
  `/__auth/login`/`/__auth/logout`, server-side re-checks. Mandatory for every
  app (see rule 3).
- **Infra** — D1 / R2 / KV / Durable Objects / containers via
  `app/app.manifest.json` (rules 4-6; heavy/long-running work:
  `references/containers.md`). Runtime + routing:
  `references/runtime-and-infra.md`. Security: `references/security.md`.
- **Brand review** (`references/brand-review.md`) — the designer's 7-criteria
  taste rubric. Run it as a self-review against your rendered screens before
  delivering; fix confident flags.
- **Launch cover** (`references/app-cover.md`) — the branded 3:2 cover + OG
  image. REQUIRED before every publish (`og_image_url` +
  `marketplace_cover_url` are mandatory feed-card fields).

**Higgsfield as the asset engine.** Any imagery the app itself needs (empty
state artwork, onboarding illustration, favicon, cover) is generated with the
Higgsfield CLI generation commands — never stock, never placeholders.

## Non-negotiable app design rules

These come from `references/quanta-design.md` — read it before building:

1. **Never customize Quanta styles** — compose, don't restyle. Rebuild missing
   small pieces from Quanta primitives; complex gaps go to the HeroUI fallback.
2. **No app header/top bar** — apps render inside Higgsfield; the host chrome
   provides the global header and account controls. Never credits/balance or
   sign-out UI. In-app navigation is a Quanta `Sidebar` or inline controls.
3. **Always dark** — `data-theme="default-dark"` is pinned; no theme toggle,
   no light mode, no `dark:` styling.
4. **Container width** — `mx-auto w-full max-w-7xl` on every shell except the
   cinema-studio full-bleed workspace.
5. **Buttons** — variant colors do NOT follow the names: `primary` = flat
   lime, `secondary` = solid white, `tertiary` = dark white/10 glass. The
   generation CTA is always `marketingPrimary` with the credit cost inside the
   button (`{label} {sparkles icon} {credits}`, credits in the label's font);
   ordinary/nav actions use the dark `tertiary`/`ghost`.

## How to build an app

1. **Intake** (ONE batched round — ask the user only for what the brief doesn't
   answer): confirm `type: "app"` is what the user wants (it is the USER'S
   choice), what the app does (which generation models/flows), and anything
   brand-critical. Never a second round — pick sensible defaults and state
   them.
2. **Create** — `higgsfield website create --type app`.
3. **Plan the screens** — pick the closest layout scaffold in
   `references/app-layouts.md`; list the screens/states (including first-run/
   empty state) and the app's own product state for D1.
4. **Build with Quanta** — copy the scaffold into routes and adapt; compose
   screens from Quanta components per `references/quanta-design.md`; HeroUI
   only for gaps. Real copy in every state (empty, busy, error) — no
   placeholders.
5. **Wire fnf end-to-end** — auth first (`references/auth.md`), then
   generation/media through server functions per `references/fnf-sdk.md` +
   `references/fnf-react.md`, product state in D1 (rules 3/3a below). Poll
   jobs, render real results.
6. **Gate** — `bun run typecheck` and `bun run qa:fill -- --strict` must pass;
   fix every item.
7. **Deploy the preview** (`higgsfield website deploy <website_id> --env
   preview`); if you can screenshot the preview (a browser or screenshot tool
   is available), capture desktop ~1440px and mobile ~390px and run the
   brand-review self-check (`references/brand-review.md`) against the
   screenshots — fix confident flags, redeploy once; if you cannot, say the
   visual review was skipped. Report the preview URL.
8. **Publish only when asked** — then the publish gate below (cover, og
   metadata) applies.

## Hard rules

### 0a. Higgsfield packages and template modules

The `app/packages/` directory contains managed snapshots vendored from the
upstream Higgsfield web app: `@higgsfield/fnf`, `@higgsfield/fnf-react`, and
`@higgsfield/quanta`. Do not edit these manually unless the task explicitly
asks to patch a package snapshot. Template-owned infrastructure lives in
`app/src/module/**`.

### 0b. Supercomputer Design mode inspector

Generated apps support a Higgsfield design inspector bridge for editable
Supercomputer previews. The split is strict:

- The Higgsfield editor (parent window) owns the iframe UI, hover overlay,
  edit popover, origin/session checks, and edit prompt submission.
- This template owns the child iframe runtime through
  `app/src/module/design-inspector`.
- Agents never manually implement inspector code, refs, source markers, or
  `data-hf-*` attributes.

Required scripts: `bun run build` (production-clean), `bun run build:design`
(editable preview, `HF_DESIGN_INSPECTOR=1`), `bun run dev:design`. Deploy the
editable **preview** only (`higgsfield website deploy <website_id> --env
preview`); never rewrite the normal `build` to include the inspector, and never
ship inspector metadata in production.

### 1. SSR-safe rendering
Every route renders on the server per request. NEVER touch browser-only
globals (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`, `navigator`) at module top
level or during render — only inside `useEffect`/event handlers, or guarded
with `typeof window !== "undefined"`. A top-level `window` reference crashes
SSR.

### 2. Server-only code stays server-only
Put server logic in `createServerFn(...).handler(...)` or a `*.server.ts`
module (the `.server.ts` suffix keeps it out of the client bundle). Secrets
and bindings are read **server-side, per request** — never shipped to the
browser.

### 3. Higgsfield (fnf) calls are BACKEND-ONLY — and auth is MANDATORY

Call Higgsfield internal services exclusively from server code at
`https://fnf.internal/*` (the platform attaches the user's identity on server
egress, so tokens never live in app code). NEVER call `https://fnf.internal/*`
from client components.

Every app is an authenticated surface. Before shipping you MUST implement the
Higgsfield auth contract exactly as written in `references/auth.md`: the
`GET /api/user` server proxy (returns the upstream status and JSON unchanged),
a signed-out state that links to `/__auth/login?return=<path>`,
`/__auth/logout?return=<path>`, and a server-side auth re-check before every
SDK operation. Do not invent your own login UI, email/password form, or token
handling, and do not build anonymous generation flows unless the user
EXPLICITLY asks for an offline/mock demo.

**Preview sign-in is platform-owned — do NOT improvise a cause if it fails.**
`/__auth/login` is a platform-injected route that hands off to Higgsfield's
auth service, then redirects back to `return` so `/api/user` succeeds. If a
user reports sign-in failing on a PREVIEW, FIRST confirm the app side is
correct (links to `/__auth/login?return=<path>`, proxies `/api/user`
unchanged); if it is, the failure is on the platform/auth side — say so
plainly instead of inventing an app-code cause.

If the app also needs its own user accounts (e.g. team members of the app's
customers), keep that separate — never replace Higgsfield auth with app-local
auth for generation.

Treat auth, profile, credits/workspace display, and a generation feed/history
as mandatory acceptance criteria for any generation app — do not wait for the
user to ask.

Generation history cards must render SDK `Generation.results`, not status-only
placeholders. Compose result cards from Quanta `Media`/`Card` using the
helpers in `app/src/lib/higgsfield-generation-results.ts` (they map a
Generation to its preview URL with the right precedence). A completed job
without a result URL must show an explicit "preview unavailable" state with
refresh behavior.

When creating SDK clients, use only
`createWorkflowPlatformAdapter({ baseUrl: 'https://fnf.internal' })` — imported
from `@higgsfield/fnf/workflow-platform` (NOT `@higgsfield/fnf/adapters`; that
subpath no longer exists) — from server-side code. Do not use public/dev fnf
URLs, env-selected backend URLs, `createFnfWebAdapter`,
`createDevFnfWebAdapter`, apps-marketplace adapters, bearer tokens, or dev
user headers in generated app code.

Generation submits require the SDK's confirmation gate: a browser confirmation
modal (model + settings + cost preview) before the generate call, and the
adapter's `confirm` option wired server-side. A declined confirmation is the
typed `confirmation_rejected` error — render it as a cancelled state. See
`references/fnf-sdk.md`, "Submission Confirmation Gate".

### 3a. An app is end-to-end — real backend + real DB, never a mock

An app MUST ship as a real, end-to-end product — NOT a front-end mock,
prototype, or "demo" that fakes the backend. All three are required:

- **A real backend.** Every data operation runs through a TanStack **server
  function** or **server route** — fnf calls server-side, reads/writes
  server-side.
- **Real persistence (D1).** Opt into D1 (`"db": true` in
  `app/app.manifest.json`) and persist the app's OWN product state:
  saved/favorited generations, collections, presets, share records, settings.
  Schema in `app/migrations/000N_*.sql` (additive; rule 5).
- **Real fnf integration.** Generations, media, profile, and credits come from
  the live SDK against `https://fnf.internal`, never hardcoded fixtures.

fnf is the source of truth for the generations themselves — do NOT mirror
fnf's tables into D1. D1 is for YOUR product layer on top.

**These are NOT a backend and are bugs:** in-memory arrays or module-level
state as "the database"; `localStorage` as the persistence layer;
hardcoded/fixture/`lorem` data; a static JSON file faking a list endpoint;
`setTimeout` faking latency; memory/mock SDK adapters shipped as the product.
The ONLY exception is when the user **explicitly** asks for an offline/mock
demo — then say plainly that it is a mock and why.

### 4. Cloudflare bindings via `cloudflare:workers`
Any infra you opt into (D1 `DB`, R2 `STORAGE`, KV `KV`) is read server-side
through `app/src/lib/bindings.server.ts`
(`import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"`). Each binding is present ONLY if
declared in `app/app.manifest.json`, so the typed accessors are optional —
guard before use. Do not thread `env` through React props or read it at
module top level.

### 5. Opted-in storage is SHARED — preview data == prod data
If you opt into D1, R2, or KV, each is a SINGLE instance **shared by the
preview and prod deploys**. Only the CODE is split (`vars.HF_ENV`). The DATA
is not. `env.HF_ENV` tells you which env it is; it CANNOT switch the
database/bucket. A destructive migration you run "just to test on preview"
hits **production data**. Prefer additive migrations
(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN`).

### 6. `app/app.manifest.json` declares infra — NOTHING is provisioned by default
A new app gets **no D1, no R2, no KV, no Durable Object**. Opt in only when
the app actually needs it: `"db": true` → D1 (`env.DB`); `"r2": true` → R2
(`env.STORAGE`); `"kv": true` → KV (`env.KV`); `"durableObject": "ClassName"`
→ a Durable Object (`env.ROOMS`, ALSO `export class ClassName extends
DurableObject {…}` from `app/src/server.ts`); `"container": true` → a Docker
container for heavy/long-running work (`env.CONTAINER` —
`references/containers.md`). Counts are capped (≤1 each); the platform
provisions and binds at deploy; the committed `app/wrangler.jsonc` is
build/dev input only. **KV is eventually consistent** (NOT Redis) — use a
Durable Object for strong consistency.

## Editing map
- Pages / routing → `app/src/routes/**` (file-based; `__root.tsx` is the shell).
- Server logic → `createServerFn` (see `app/src/lib/api/example.functions.ts`)
  or `*.server.ts`.
- Bindings access → `app/src/lib/bindings.server.ts`.
- Infra declaration → `app/app.manifest.json`; `app/wrangler.jsonc` = build/dev
  input.
- Components → Quanta components first (`@higgsfield/quanta/*` — Button,
  Input, Textarea, Dropdown, Modal, Tabs, Sidebar, Chip, …), app-local
  composition in `app/src/components/**`; layout per
  `references/app-layouts.md`; HeroUI for gaps.
- Generation result UI → compose from Quanta `Media`/`Card` +
  `app/src/lib/higgsfield-generation-results.ts`.
- Styles / theme → `app/src/styles.css` (Tailwind v4 + Quanta + HeroUI wiring —
  leave it alone). Quanta's `q-` tokens ARE the theme; the app is permanently
  dark.
- D1 schema → `app/migrations/000N_*.sql` (additive; see rule 5).

## Verify + deploy

The trusted platform CI builds the app on **every deploy** (preview →
`bun run build:design`, production → `bun run build`), so a deploy already
gives you the authoritative build result. The sandbox cannot deploy/migrate;
the trusted platform CI does that.

**Default: build, pass the gates (`bun run typecheck`,
`bun run qa:fill -- --strict`), deploy the preview**
(`higgsfield website deploy <website_id> --env preview`), then the brand-review
screenshot self-check. Never deploy production unless the user explicitly asked
to publish.

**Publishing ("show in feed").** When the user asks to publish / share / put
the app on the feed, run `higgsfield website publish <website_id>` — it deploys
the pushed `main` to PRODUCTION and lists the app on the Higgsfield community feed.

**HARD GATE — the cover is NOT optional. Running `higgsfield website publish` while
`og_image_url` or `marketplace_cover_url` is empty is a BROKEN publish** (the
feed card renders ONLY from `app/src/app-meta.json`; an empty `og_title` makes
the listing INVISIBLE, an empty cover makes it a blank card). The publish
sequence is: (a) READ `app/src/app-meta.json`; (b) if `og_image_url` or
`marketplace_cover_url` is empty → STOP, read `references/app-cover.md` and
generate + upload the cover NOW — do not skip this because the user "only asked
to publish", the cover IS part of publishing; (c) fill ALL fields below with
real values (never placeholders); (d) commit + push; (e) only then run
`higgsfield website publish`:

1. `og_title` — the card's title (also the browser tab title).
2. `og_description` — the card's one-liner.
3. `og_image_url` — REQUIRED: the cover image, generated per
   `references/app-cover.md` (the branded 3:2 cover + stadium-capsule OG
   mask) if none exists yet; upload the OG file with `higgsfield upload create`
   and set the returned durable URL.
4. `marketplace_cover_url` — REQUIRED: the plain (unmasked) cover, the same
   generation's `<name>_cover.png` from `references/app-cover.md`, uploaded
   with `higgsfield upload create`. One generation fills both this and
   `og_image_url` — there is never a reason to have one without the other.
5. `favicon_url` — the card's logo/icon (generate one if none exists yet).
6. `og_video_url` — the **cover video**, OPTIONAL and permission-gated: OFFER
   it to the user ("want a short cover video for the feed card?") and ASK
   PERMISSION FIRST — generating a video costs credits; never generate it
   unprompted. If they say yes, follow "Cover video" in `references/seo.md`.

(1–5 are generated without asking — they are part of the publish, not a
separate credit decision; only the cover VIDEO (6) needs permission.)

`higgsfield website deploy <website_id> --env production` remains the way to ship
to production WITHOUT a feed listing.

**Run the local checks only when you actually need them** — from `app/`:
```bash
cd app
bun install          # only when you changed dependencies / package.json
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
bun run build        # production-clean build
bun run build:design # editable Supercomputer preview build
```

**Small edits to an existing app** (copy tweak, one component, styling fix):
make the edit, run `bun run qa:fill -- --strict`, deploy the preview. Re-run
the brand-review screenshot check only when the edit changed layout/visual
structure — not for a typo fix.

**Before claiming a build done / deploying, no placeholders may remain.** Run
`bun run qa:fill -- --strict` (add `--url <preview>` to also scan the rendered
page). It fails if any template placeholder survives — a `<...>`-style token,
`lorem ipsum`, or the scaffold blank-page marker (`REMOVE_THIS` /
`blank-app-v1`). It is a completion gate, not a CI build step.
